KlinikAI is an advanced, AI-powered platform designed to revolutionize how healthcare professionals access and interpret patient medical histories. It transforms scattered, unstructured medical records into a centralized, intelligent knowledge base, allowing for rapid, conversational access to a patient's complete clinical past.
üåü Overview
In a fast-paced clinical environment, sifting through numerous files‚Äîlab results, consultation notes, and discharge summaries‚Äîis time-consuming and risks overlooking critical information. KlinikAI addresses this challenge by providing a smart assistant that can synthesize information from all patient records and answer complex questions in plain language.
This project uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to provide accurate, context-aware answers, ensuring that all generated information is grounded in the source documents.
‚ú® Key Features
Unified Patient History: Consolidates various document formats (PDF, TXT, DOCX) into a single, queryable knowledge base.
Natural Language Querying: Ask specific questions like "Summarize all cardiac-related events" or "List all medications prescribed in the last year" and get direct answers.
Intelligent Summarization: Delivers on-demand, coherent summaries of a patient's entire medical history.
Source Verification: Cites the source documents for its generated answers, allowing for easy verification of information.
Reduced Administrative Burden: Frees up valuable time for healthcare providers, allowing them to focus on patient care instead of paperwork.
Improved Clinical Decision-Making: Provides a holistic patient view to help identify patterns and make more informed decisions.
‚öôÔ∏è How It Works: The RAG Architecture
KlinikAI operates on a robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline:
Indexing: All patient medical records are loaded, split into manageable chunks, and converted into numerical representations (vector embeddings). These are stored in a specialized vector database.
Retrieval: When a user asks a question, the query is also converted into a vector. The system then performs a similarity search in the vector database to find the most relevant chunks of text from the source documents.
Generation: The user's original query and the retrieved text chunks are passed to a Large Language Model (LLM). The LLM is prompted to generate a comprehensive, human-readable answer based only on the provided context.
Response: The final, synthesized answer is presented to the user, with optional citations to the source documents.
