KlinikAI is an advanced, AI-powered platform designed to revolutionize how healthcare professionals access and interpret patient medical histories. It transforms scattered, unstructured medical records into a centralized, intelligent knowledge base, allowing for rapid, conversational access to a patient's complete clinical past.




 Overview
In a fast-paced clinical environment, sifting through numerous files—lab results, consultation notes, and discharge summaries—is time-consuming and risks overlooking critical information. KlinikAI addresses this challenge by providing a smart assistant that can synthesize information from all patient records and answer complex questions in plain language.
This project uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to provide accurate, context-aware answers, ensuring that all generated information is grounded in the source documents



 Key Features
Unified Patient History: Consolidates various document formats (PDF, TXT, DOCX) into a single, queryable knowledge base.
Natural Language Querying: Ask specific questions like "Summarize all cardiac-related events" or "List all medications prescribed in the last year" and get direct answers.
Intelligent Summarization: Delivers on-demand, coherent summaries of a patient's entire medical history.
Source Verification: Cites the source documents for its generated answers, allowing for easy verification of information.
Reduced Administrative Burden: Frees up valuable time for healthcare providers, allowing them to focus on patient care instead of paperwork.
Improved Clinical Decision-Making: Provides a holistic patient view to help identify patterns and make more informed decisions.



How It Works: The RAG Architecture
KlinikAI operates on a robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline:
Indexing: All patient medical records are loaded, split into manageable chunks, and converted into numerical representations (vector embeddings). These are stored in a specialized vector database.
Retrieval: When a user asks a question, the query is also converted into a vector. The system then performs a similarity search in the vector database to find the most relevant chunks of text from the source documents.
Generation: The user's original query and the retrieved text chunks are passed to a Large Language Model (LLM). The LLM is prompted to generate a comprehensive, human-readable answer based only on the provided context.
Response: The final, synthesized answer is presented to the user, with optional citations to the source documents.


 Zero-Shot Prompting with Groq API (LLaMA3)

This project demonstrates how to send a zero-shot prompt to the Groq API using the LLaMA 3 model and get a response backall via a simple Node.js script.


 What This Project Does

 Loads your Groq API key from a `.env` file securely using `dotenv`
Sends a prompt (like a question or task) to Groq's LLaMA 3 model
 Prints out the AI response in the terminal
 Uses zero-shot prompting, meaning we ask the model to do something without giving it examples

 Technologies Used

 Node.js
 Axios (for API requests)
 Dotenv (for environment variable management)
 Groq API (https://console.groq.com/)


 Multi-Shot Prompting with Groq API
This project demonstrates multi-shot prompting using the Groq API with the llama3-8b-8192 model.
Multi-shot prompting helps guide the AI by providing multiple examples of the desired input-output pattern before asking it to generate a new response.

 What is Multi-Shot Prompting?
Multi-shot prompting is when you give the AI two or more examples of what you want before asking your real question.
It’s like showing the AI "Here’s how I want my answers to look" before it starts.

Benefits:

Correctness: AI follows the given format more accurately.

Efficiency: Less need to correct or re-run prompts.

Scalability: Easily adapted to larger datasets or more examples.

You are a movie recommendation assistant. Given a user’s mood and preferred genre, suggest 3 movies with short descriptions.

Example 1:
User Mood: Happy
Preferred Genre: Comedy
Output:
The Intern – Lighthearted workplace comedy with warm moments.
Crazy Rich Asians – Fun, vibrant rom-com with cultural twists.
 Paddington – Wholesome humor with lovable characters.

Example 2:
User Mood: Thoughtful
Preferred Genre: Sci-Fi
Output:
Arrival – Deep, emotional story about language and time.
 Interstellar – Space exploration with emotional stakes.
 Her – AI romance with introspective themes.

Now your turn:
User Mood: Adventurous
Preferred Genre: Action
In this prompt:

The first two examples teach the AI the desired style and structure.

The final case is left incomplete, so the AI continues the pattern.
